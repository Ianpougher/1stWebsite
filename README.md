This is a basic linux command website That I made for CS2610. 

The Second Assignment Required me to add in CSS elements to my already existing website, something that I wasn't too fond of, so I decided to make intentionally bad CSS to complete assignment.

I also Decided to expiriment with javascript and custom javascript librarys for additional practice.
